This example demonstrates a common error in Swift when using the `reduce` function with an array of strings. The `+` operator is overloaded, causing ambiguity when the compiler cannot infer the intended operation (addition or concatenation). The solution shows how to explicitly specify string concatenation using the `+` operator or a more robust and type-safe approach using the `joined()` method.
